# 🌌 What is science
In short, science is the pursuit and collection of knowledge about our universe, using an evidence-based method grounded in observation, experimentation, and critical analysis.
> The word **science** comes from the Latin "scientia", which means **knowledge** or **understanding**. 

When we study life, we call it biology — the science of living things — focused on understanding how they work, grow, and interact.

To make this vast body of knowledge concrete and reliable, we rely on careful observation, controlled experimentation, and logical reasoning. That’s what sets science apart from guesswork — it’s grounded in evidence.

## Are software engineers scientists
- A computer scientist creates a new material → an engineer uses it to build something.
- An engineer develops a new tool → a scientist uses it to discover something new.
> Developing simple things (like web applications or general software) doesn’t make you a scientist. You can be a computer science student, but not a computer scientist — unless you’re contributing new discoveries to the field, like Alan Turing, for instance.

# 💾 Computer Science
Computer science is one of many branches of science. When you're studying computer science — also known as CS — you're diving into the vast body of knowledge we’ve built around computers and computation.

We study and improve our understanding of computers so we can develop solutions using computational technology. The main goal is to automate the resolution of real-world problems through a structured process, which can be summarized as follows:
```
    1. Collect data (inputs)
    2. Process the data (using algorithms)
    3. Generate results (outputs)
```

## Humans follow the same structured process as computers: input → process → output
We often think of computers as the only ones that follow a structured pattern to solve problems—but this model actually comes from us, human beings.

Take conversations, for example. When someone asks us a question, we receive it as input. We think about it—that's our brain doing the processing—and then we give an answer: the output.

Here's a simple example:
- [Your friend]: "Where is your dog?"
- [You]: "He's in my apartment."

From your friend's perspective, the question is an output—they're sending information out. For you, it's an input. Your brain processes the question and quickly finds the answer, which becomes your output, sent back as a response.
