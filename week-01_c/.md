# Variables 
This is just a fancy name to describe a few actions that happen under the hood. When you create a variable, what you're really doing is reserving a space in memory, and the identifier (the variable's name) points to that memory address. With the assignment operator (=), you can store a value in that memory location.
    
```
    int age = 19;
    // Reserves memory and assigns 19 to it; 'age' points to that memory location.
```

# Data types 
Data types determine how much of memory our variable is going to take. Quanto mais alto the value we need to save, more memory we must take.
