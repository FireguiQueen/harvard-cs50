# Variables 
This is just a fancy name to describe a few actions that happen under the hood. When you create a variable, what you're really doing is reserving a space in memory, and the identifier (the variable's name) points to that memory address. With the assignment operator (=), you can store a value in that memory location.
    
```
    int age = 19;
    // Reserves memory and assigns 19 to it; 'age' points to that memory location.
```

# Data types 
Data types determine how much memory is reserved when you create a variable. The value you want to store must "fit" within that space. If it requires more bits than the allocated memory, it can't be stored correctly.

### `short`
This creates a 2-byte space in memory — that's 16 bits. With 16 bits, we can represent 2¹⁶ = 65,536 different values.
But since we also need to store negative numbers, that range is split in half:
- Half for negative values
- Half for positive values (including zero)

So the range of a short is typically:
-32,768 to 32,767

Example: `short temperature = -10`;


### `int` (integer)
An int creates a 4-byte space in memory — that's 32 bits. With 32 bits, we can represent 2³² = 4,294,967,296 different values.

So the range of an int is: -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

Example: int population = 1000000;




When your function return something, that is, is not a void function, you must pick a data type. If the function returns a integer (-50, -1, 0, 1, 4, 5..
