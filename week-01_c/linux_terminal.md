# Commands  
Commands are instructions that you can enter in a terminal or command line interface of a Unix- or Linux-based operating system to perform various tasks. These tasks include managing files and directories, navigating through the file system, interacting with software, and much more.

Commands are the primary means of interacting with the operating system, enabling users to control, configure, and automate a wide range of operations efficiently.
