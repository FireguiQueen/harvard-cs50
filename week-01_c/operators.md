# Operators

In programming, operators are essential tools that allow us to perform various operations, such as arithmetic calculations and logical evaluations. Every programming language provides a set of standard operators.

## Arithmetic Operators

These operators are used to perform basic mathematical operations:

- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `/` : Division
- `*` : Multiplication
- `%` : Modulus (returns the remainder of a division)

## Logical Operators

Logical operators are used to combine or compare expressions and control the flow of a program based on conditions.

### `&&` (Logical AND)

Returns `true` only if **both** expressions are true.
